          IF is complicated and-while we wish we could say that it&apos; s
          possible to absorb all the details during the 5 - 30 minute visits
          with your doctor--that&apos; s really not the case.This comprehensive
          guide to IVF boils down every major issue you&apos;ll encounter-a high
          level overview of the IVF process, a deeper dive into the IF process,
          IF success rates and how they differ depending on diagnosis and age,
          the medication protocols that can be used during IF, the choice of
          inseminating eggs either using ICSI fertilization or conventional
          insemination, the pros and cons of growing embryos to Day 3 cleavage
          stage or Day 5 blastocyst stage, the decisions around genetic
          screening of embryos, deciding which embryo to transfer, deciding how
          many embryos to transfer at once, the ways the IVF laboratory can
          impact your odds of success and the things you need to know up front
          to avoid going to the wrong lab for you, the risks of IVF, and the
          costs of IVF. We&apos;re always sure to provide details about how data
          might be different depending on unique types of patients--because in
          the world of fertility, it&apos;s really not one-size-fits-all. We
          truly believe this guide is the foundation every fertility patient
          should start with when they&apos;re navigating the world of
          treatments.
